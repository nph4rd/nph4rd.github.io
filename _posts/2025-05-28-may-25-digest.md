In the spirit of [kipply's](https://kipp.ly/) things read/digest posts and [Tyler Cowen's](https://marginalrevolution.com/) assorted links, I will start posting interesting things I read or discovered. I'll start on a monthly basis.

May has been a great.

- A compilation of [√Ålvaro Mutis](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lvaro_Mutis)' poems which I couldn't have read in a more adequate location. Favorite poem [here](https://www.revistadelauniversidad.mx/articles/6cc909c2-66a7-40ba-8aa5-681dd3438cd1/nocturno):

- [Alessandro Baricco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Baricco)'s [Oceano Mare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Sea_(novel)). Loved the Bartleboom-Plasson duplo.
- An [anthropology.net post](https://www.anthropology.net/p/when-the-sky-burned-how-a-weakened) on the [Laschamps excursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laschamp_event), when the "Earth‚Äôs magnetic field [...] flickered and faltered".
- Wikipedia's entry on the [Zanclean flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanclean_flood), a flood that reconnected the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea after the [Messinian salinity crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messinian_salinity_crisis) in a matter of months! It is estimated "that water rushed down a drop of more than 1,000 metres (3,300¬†ft) with a maximum discharge of about 100¬†million cubic metres per second (3.5¬†billion cubic feet per second), about 1,000 times that of the present-day¬†Amazon River." Imagine that!
- About [ingressive speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingressive_sound). I first learned about it through an Instagram reel that my wife showed me. It particularly caught our attention because locals in villages near where we live in Mexico also use a kind of [inhaled "yeah"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingressive_sound#Inhaled_affirmative_'yeah'). I wonder if this linguistic trait was passed down through Spanish or through [N√°huatl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuatl)!
- Learnt about [slothful induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slothful_induction). I have started to point it out :)
- And these two, which are fun: [Wojtek, the bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojtek_(bear)) and [Italian brainrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_brainrot), so in honor of Wojtek:
