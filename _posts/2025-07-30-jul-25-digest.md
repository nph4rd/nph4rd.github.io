```

- The [Barnum effect](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect).
- Stuart Kauffman's [Investigations](https://www.santafe.edu/research/results/working-papers/investigations), on autonomous agents. I wanted to get a different outlook on the idea of agents. I have to say, I wasn't surprised by the book. I thought it was both too general and, simultaneously, excessively detailed on certain parts. It would be cool to know what Kauffman thinks of the current state of AI though.
- This essay by Ethan Smith [on the need for prediction](https://www.ethansmith2000.com/post/intelligence-was-born-out-of-a-need-to-predict-the-future).
- Late to the party, but I finally read Anthropic's [multiagent research system blogpost](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system).
- The [Red Queen Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis) via Chaitin's Metabiology.
- About the world's largest hydropower facility, the [Medog Hydropower Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medog_Hydropower_Station), whose construction [just started in July](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/china-embarks-worlds-largest-hydropower-dam-capital-markets-cheer-2025-07-21/).
- Finally, via [croissanthology](https://croissanthology.com/), I read the entry on [Cockaigne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockaigne), the [Goliardic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliards) utopia. My brother (who currently lives in Toulouse) brought to my attention that, actually, _les boules de cocagne_ are the balls of crushed leaves of _Isatis Tinctoria_, the plant used to produce the traditional _pastel_ blue in the Albi-Carcassonne-Toulouse region.

This is not mentioned in the English entry, but there's arguably a very clear relation between the abundance brought to the region by the commerce of _pastel_ and Cockaigne as a land-of-plenty.

Another curious thing I learnt is that one of the traditions related to Cockaigne is the [greasy pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasy_pole) game (?), where participants try to climb a pole that has been previously greased-up. You can imagine how hard that is. Anyway, Francisco Goya, illustrated it beautifully in _La cucaña_:

When I saw the painting and read about the tradition I immediately recognized it as something I had seen before. Indeed, during ~2023 I lived in a neighborhood where people too climbed up greasy poles every once in a while! Apparently this is called the "palo ensebado". Here's a photo I took of the event back then:

Like Goya himself!
