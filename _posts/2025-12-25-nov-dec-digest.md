To end the year:

- Epoch AI's post on [Claudiness](https://epochai.substack.com/p/benchmark-scores-general-capability). FWIW, I think we're on the contingent world.
- I re-read Alvaro de Menard's great essay  [On the Pleb Filter](https://www.fantasticanachronism.com/p/on-the-pleb-filter).
- Máximo Sandín's [ideas](https://somosbacteriasyvirus.net/) on viruses and bacterias as "evolutionary engines". I first heard about him from G. Chaitin, and now Blaise Agüera y Arcas' [What is Intelligence?](https://whatisintelligence.antikythera.org/) book made me think about it again, specially the chapter on [virality](https://whatisintelligence.antikythera.org/chapter-01/#virality).
- [hbd chick](https://x.com/hbdchick)'s post on the [Hajnal line](https://hbdchick.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/big-summary-post-on-the-hajnal-line/).
- Casey Handmer's [Energy Predictions 2025](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2025/12/08/energy-predictions-2025/).
- About the undersea wall from 5000 BC, that was [recently found in France](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crk7lg1j146o).
- Finally, I heard from my beautiful wife about the word [木漏れ日](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%9C%A8%E6%BC%8F%E3%82%8C%E6%97%A5) (komorebi) to refer to "sunlight filtering through trees", and I dedicate this photo I took to her:
